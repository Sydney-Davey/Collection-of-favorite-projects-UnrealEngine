About this project: 

At the beginning of the semester, my first project in my Game Engines 2 class was a timed first-person shooter where you had to shoot all the cubes in 20 seconds, otherwise it ended the game. While making the game itself was not the most difficult project I dealt with this semester, it was the first project I got to deepdive into Unreal Engine's documentation and really learn how I can gather the information best. First, I skimmed through the document to make sure it was potentially a solution or on the correct topic I was looking for, which made sure I wasn't wasting time reading through a doc that wasn't on topic. Then I would look back at the sections that were most relevant to what info I was looking for, this could be, and is not limited to, a description, usage, or error fix. This really sped up my research process this semester and helped me accomplish more with a project since I was not spending a much time on one problem.
