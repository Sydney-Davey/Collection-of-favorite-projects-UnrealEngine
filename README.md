# Collection-of-best-works-UnrealEngine
About this project: 

At the beginning of the semester, my first project in Game Engines 2 was a timed first-person shooter.  In this, you have to shoot all the cubes in 20 seconds, otherwise, the game ends. While making the game was not difficult, it was the first project I could deep-dive into Unreal Engine's documentation and learn how to gather the information best. First, I skimmed through the document to make sure it was applicable, which ensured I wasn't wasting time reading through the documentation. Then, I would read sections most relevant to the information I was looking for.  Some examples of what I found include: description, usage and error fix. This sped up my research process and helped me accomplish more because I was not spending as much time on one problem.
